                and I have been working with computers my entire life. I have
                been interested in coding since high school and I'm now enrolled
                at Full Sail University to recieve a Bachelor's in Computer
                Science at the end of 2023.

                My main programming experience is with{' '}

                JavaScript, React, Python, C#, HTML, CSS, and Node.js.

                {' '}I'm constantly keeping up to date with new documentation and
                enhancing my knowledge of current programming concepts. It's
                important for me to be the best at what I do and strive to be
                the hardest working developer that I can be.

                A few of my other hobbies are powerlifting, rock-climbing, and
                pretty much anything outdoors. I like seeing a goal, mapping out
                the process of getting to the end, and then tackling each
                problem along the way.
