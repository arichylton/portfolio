                and I have now been programming for the last six years. I have
                recently graduated, at the end of 2023, from Full Sail
                University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
              </span>
              <p>
                My main programming experience is with{" "}
                <p style={{ color: "rgb(16, 234, 250)" }}>
                  React, TypeScript, Go, TailwindCSS, Python, and Node.js.
                </p>{" "}
                I'm constantly keeping up to date with new documentation and
                enhancing my knowledge of current programming concepts. It's
                important for me to be the best at what I do and I'm highly
                motivated to keep improving.
              </p>

                A few of my other hobbies are powerlifting, rock-climbing, and
                pretty much anything outdoors. I like seeing a goal, mapping out
                the process of getting to the end, and then tackling each
                problem along the way.

          <img src={personalPhoto} className="about__me-section-pic" />

      </AnimationOnScroll>
    </section>
  );
